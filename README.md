##Description
An app that calculates whether a triangle is equilateral, scalene, isosceles, or not a triangle at all based on user input of side lengths.

##Technologies Used
Javascript <br>
<a href='https://jquery.com/download/'>jQuery-1.11.2</a> <br>
<a href='http://mochajs.org/'>Mocha</a> <br>
<a href='http://chaijs.com/'>Chai</a>


##Use and Editing
To use the app, <br>
1. Clone the repository. `git clone https://github.com/k-giardchase/triangle.git`<br>
2. Change directories into the folder `cd triangle`<br>
3. In the top level of the project folder, open index.html in your web browser.
<br>NOTE: to view CSS animation, it is best to use a google chrome browser.<br><br>
To edit the app, you will need jQuery, as well as Mocha and Chai to run BDD tests. These libraries/frameworks are already located in the js and specs folders, respectively. <br><br>
